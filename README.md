# Auto-Pause
Auto-Pause is a simple .NET program for Windows that toggles your music when you press mute.

## How to use
The program starts minimized in the taskbar. Double-clicking on the pause icon will bring up a GUI to configure the tool.

The easiest way to use it is to press Get Foreground and quickly select your music player. After 3 seconds from clicking, it will auto-detect your music player and bring up the recommended key press to pause your music.

If the program does not recognize your player, you can enter a custom keyboard shortcut in the box that will toggle the music playing.

Finally, minimize (don't close) the program and it'll handle the rest! Just press mute and it'll quickly find your window and toggle playing. If you have selected the minimize option, then it'll even hide the window for you every time.

## Pause Desync
Thereâ€™s always a chance that for one reason or another, the pausing will occur on unmute. To fix this, hold control and press mute to toggle only muting and not the audio.

## Contribution
If you have a music player that is not supported, please leave me an issue telling me the name of the player and the key press to toggle playing and I will add it.
